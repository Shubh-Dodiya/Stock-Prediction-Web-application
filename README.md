# üìà Stock Prediction Dashboard

A user-friendly and interactive web dashboard for visualizing historical stock data and forecasting future prices using the Prophet time-series model. Built with Streamlit, Prophet, and yfinance.

## üìä Project Overview

This project is an interactive web dashboard designed for visualizing historical stock prices and forecasting future trends. Built with Python, Streamlit, and Facebook's Prophet model, it provides a user-friendly interface to fetch, analyze, and predict data for any stock ticker available on Yahoo Finance.

The dashboard allows users to dynamically select a stock, define a historical date range, and specify the number of future days to forecast. The results are presented in clean, interactive charts, separating historical data from the predictive forecast, complete with confidence intervals.

### Key Features

* **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Pulls real-time and historical stock data directly from Yahoo Finance.
* **Predictive Forecasting**: Utilizes the robust Prophet time-series model to generate future price predictions.
* **Interactive Controls**: Users can easily customize the stock symbol, date range, forecast duration, and seasonality parameters through a simple sidebar menu.
* **Rich Visualizations**: Employs Plotly to create beautiful, interactive charts with zoom, pan, and hover capabilities.
* **Data Export**: Allows users to download the generated forecast data as a CSV file for further offline analysis.
* **Clean UI**: A dual-tab interface neatly separates the historical data view from the forecast results for a clear and intuitive user experience.
